    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

Of course there are other attributes that factor into the selling price of a home, like the size, or in this case, the `'RM'` values, however, from what I have seen, the main driver is the quality of the school district. \n",

    "As to the 'LSTAT'` values.  Again, all else being equal, I expect that a home in a neighborhood with a lower 'LSTAT'` value to have a **higher value** than one with a higher value.  The reason for this is that neighborhoods are generally clusters of people in the same income bracket, therefore, a higher `'LSTAT'` value means that there is more people of a lower class in that neighborhood.  In addition, the home values of folks that are of a lower class are generally lower since their incomes are lower.\n",

School overcrowding can be one metric that gauges the cost/value of a home since overcrowded class rooms are typically seen in lower class/cost areas (this can be related to the overall quality of an education as well).  That being said, I expect that lower `'PTRATIO'` values to result in a higher home price since the quality of the education tends to also be higher in these situations.  Like I said at the start:\n",

    "- Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.cross_validation` to shuffle and split the `features` and `prices` data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "  - Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.\n",
    "  - Set the `random_state` for `train_test_split` to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.\n",
    "- Assign the train and testing splits to `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`."

    "**Answer Question 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using `'train_test_split'` in modeling is that it allows you to ensure that the model does not over- or under-fit the data since you will evaluate the model using data (i.e., the `'test'` set) that the model has not seen.  This in-turn ensures that the model is able to generalize well to out of sample data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes from reviewer**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Great implementation. How ever, the train/test split has no definitive impact on whether a model will over fit or underfit.\n",
    "Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">How good will be the learning for a model totally depends on how much relevant information is contained in the data set. DO you think a train data set with 80,000 rows and test data of 20,000 rows result in a better trained model? How about 70,000 and 30,000? Well, we can't say anything about that definitively.\n",
    "\n",
    ">What if the data is about some sensor readings and it senses environment 100 times in a second. So for one second of time, 100 rows would be present. That means 100,000 (80,000+20,000) would represent 1000 seconds data only which means data of about 16.66 minutes. Would you expect this model trained on ~16.66 minutes to perform well 24x7x52 (round the year?). Obviously not. Here we need more data to get a better trained model and not a good split or a split at all!\n",
    "\n",
    ">When it comes to measuring generalization, we do it by observing the model performance on a data set which has not been seen by the ML model. When we are talking about the model evaluation on the unseen data, we would need the true values for that unseen data for us to compare the model predictions with. If we train the model on the whole available data set, would we be able to check its performance on unseen data set? Modify your answer to reflect above mentioned points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using `'train_test_split'` is to determine how well does a model perform on data that it has not seen.  The *cardinal rule* of machine learning is to not test the model on data that the model has already seen since that could introduce biases into the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to evaluate model performance is to test the model on data that it has not seen.  Given that the amount of that we have to work with can be limited, meaning that it may not be possible to get more, one way to both, quantify model performance and not break the cardinal rule of machine learning is to split your initial data set into testing and training sets using the `'train_test_split'` function in SK Learn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `'train_test_split'` function will take the initial data set and split it into two, a training set, that is used to train the model, and a testing set, that is used to evaluate the performance of the model. When using `'train_test_split'`, the testing data is data that the model has not seen before (i.e., has not been used to train the model). \n",
    "\n",
    "As it relates to under fitting or overfitting, when we split the initial dataset into two using `'train_test_split'`, we are able to determine overfitting or under fitting using the model complexity curves since for each point in the testing set, we'll know both the actual and predicted values of each point that is used to base predictions (independent variable) off of (this is the validation score or curve).  The other curve that is needed for a model complexity chart is the training score, that is generated from the training set.  \n"

    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

    "**Answer Question 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the four charts presented, the one where `'max_depth=1'` seems to fit the data best.  The reason being that the for `'max_depth=1'`, the error of the `'training'` and `'testing'` sets are converging to a lower number, than say,  `'max_depth=3'`. In passing, the charts for `'max_depth=6'` and `'max_depth=10'` don't seem to be converging. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you add more points to the datasets, the training error should increase since there is more data to fit, however, the testing error should decrease since we have a better model that has been trained with more data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, having more training data increases the training error, however, in the long run, you will have a better model since has seen more points, and is more likely to generalize better since it has the ability to pick up all of the nuances in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is noted that there is a point at which the training and the testing curves to approach each other (with a very small distance between them). In this case, adding more training data to the model, may not result in a better training score. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note from reviewer**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Your answer is giving me a feeling that you think that the model error is plotted on Y-axis. But if you see closely, Y-axis represents the model score (performance ) and not the error. In the light of this fact your answer should change. Also, after a particular value of number of training points, the training and testing curves have flattened out. That means for any number of training points, the score would remain the same. Do you think adding more points would help given the above observation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is understood that the value of the y-axis is the \"score\" as opposed to the \"error.\"  As to the value of the value of the `'score'`, I believe that the value that is being reported is the `'F1'` score. That being said, the model that has `'max_depth=3'` offers the model that classifies the points the best, since it has the highest `'F1'` score that also converges to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "As to the question \"Do you think adding more points would help given the above observation?\".  I offer the following, that was noted in my initial response.\n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer Question 5:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As to the chart with `'max_depth=1'`, I wold say that the is the sweet spot for the model since the error is at the minimum.  It seems that as the `'max_depth'` approaches four, that the model starts to show high bias (underfit), but as the depth increases, the model starts to show high variance or overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key clues that show that the model is over fitting is the the distance between the training and testing scores, on the complexity chart, is getting larger. Visual clues that a model is underfit is that the delta between the training and testing scores are small, however, the point at where they converge is not at the minimum. "

    "**Answer Question 8:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When assessing model performance, it is important that the model be tested on data that the model **has not** seen.  The reason for this is that you don't want to introduce bias into the model that could affect the ability to generalize. As a result, it is common practice to split the data up into training and testing sets as in the case of `'train_test_split'` in SK Learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `'train_test_split'`, the testing set, is always going to be the same data points. Since the goal of building a model is to have a model that generalizes on out of sample data, it is possible, that biases could be introduced into the dataset when doing `'train_test_split'` since the testing and training set will always include the same datapoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this potential source of bias, it is customary to test the performance of the model using different points in the testing and training set.  The problem here, however, is that we only have a set amount of data points, and the cardinal rule is to never test a model using data points that the model has already seen. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, one can use k-fold cross validation.  In k-fold cross validation, the data set is sub divided into `'k'` divisions of equal size. Once the divisions have been made, the model is trained with `'k-1'` data points, and the then tested with data from the k<sup>th</sup> subdivision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for `'k'` times and an accuracy or `'F1'` score computed for each step.  Once the model has been trained and evaluated `'k'` times, the average performance is provided and used to describe the model.  Put in another way, k-fold cross validation ensures that the training and testing of the model is homogeneous across all of the data points, while still complying with the cardinal rule of next testing a model using data points that the model has already seen during the testing phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "As to the use of cross validation and grid search. As noted in the [SK learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation):\n",
    "\n",
    "> When evaluating different settings (“hyper parameters”) for estimators, such as the C setting that must be manually set for an SVM, there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the model does not inadvertently learn about nuances of the dataset when going through a grid search, cross validation is used since model performance will be judged over a series of `'k'` times thereby removing the ability of the model to learn about nuances of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note from reviewer**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Great explanation. There are certain finer details of this concept, which you should know and which should be part of your answer. Let me explain as these are the points generally asked in Data Science / Machine Learning interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    ">K-fold CV is an algorithm validation technique: whether a given algorithm will train properly or not. When you get different models from different folds, what you do is average out the evaluation metric of all the models to get what?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Well, to get an 'unbiased estimate of model generaliztion on unseen data'. That is the main purpose of k-fold cross validation. Once we are satisfied that a particular algorithm is good for a particular data set, we test it on the dataset we had kept aside at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A bit about k-fold using an example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Let us assume we have 100 rows in total. Out of these 100 rows, let us say 20 rows are taken out for final testing of the model and 80 rows are kept for training. Now these 80 rows are divided into k-folds. If we assume k to be 10, then each fold consists of 8 rows. Now out of these folds, one fold having 8 rows is kept as validation and rest 72 rows are used as training. This process is repeated with each fold being one validation set. Once we are sure about our model, the final model performance is check on the 20 rows we had taken out in the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Its application on grid -search:\n",
    "\n",
    ">We take one hyperparameter combination from the grid and keep it constant for one round of whole k-fold cross validation process: the whole splitting into kfolds, training and validating on one fold and so on. This helps us in getting an unbiased estimate of model evaluation metric which helps us decide in a more unbiased way, whether the given combination of hyperparameters is best for the particular data set or not. This process is repeated for all combinations of hyperparameters in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Using the train-test split method to evaluate model or choose best hyper parameters has a risk. The data set in the fixed train-test method may result in optimum hyper-parameter combination which is good for only that particularly arranged training dataset. To get rid of this bias towards a specific arrangement and composition of data, k-fold becomes useful.\n",

The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*.

Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given.

    "**Answer Question 11:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we trained a model to predict the selling home price in Boston.  While predictions are made from what seems to be a robust model, care should be exercised when solely relying on this model to make predictions for the following reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the data used to train the model was collected in 1978.  Home prices have changed from 1978, due to inflation, and this must be considered when using this model.  One possible correction is to correct the predicted price to 2018 dollars using a standard rate of inflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, calculating the actual price of a home is a complex endeavor that can use multiple inputs or features.  In this model, we have built a model that uses only three features to predict the home price, but there are indeed others that can be used. One of these additional features is the crime rate of the neighborhood.  While more features can be certainly added to the model, one must exercise care because not all features added to the model are valuable.  It is possible to add more features to the model and at the same time add more noise to the model.  To get around this, is is best to look at the importance of each feature to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, while the model does make predictions, it should be noted that the model may be overfit given the `'max_depth=4'` value.  When looking at the chart from Question 6, it suggest that the model may be overfit relative to a `'max_depth=1'`.  To ensure that the model is not overfit, I would run the complexity analysis again, but use the results from a 10-fold cross validation as opposed to points generated from the `train_test_split`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, the model does not consider the fact that Boston is a urban city and people may want to use the model to predict home prices in a rural setting. Home prices in a rural setting may be lower and therefore, this model could estimate higher prices in a rural setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fifth, in my opinion, it is not 100% fare to judge a home price solely by the characteristics of the entire neighborhood, although, in my experience, this does play a strong component in the overall price.  A new home in a poor neighborhood may be priced artificially low, even if it has a high amount of bedrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, while models can make predictions about future events, care must be exercised when relying on the data.  It is important to have context about the data used to create the model as well as domain knowledge when using or building a model to ensure that the output of a model is used correctly. \n",
